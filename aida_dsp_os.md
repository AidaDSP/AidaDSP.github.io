## Aida DSP OS

Aida DSP OS is the innovative product that could make you leave your Pc at home: when you're going
to do some rehersal, in the recording studio, or outside, in search of new sounds. It's based on the same
technology of the _**Mod Duo**_, a device presented at _NAMM 2017_. In addition to that, you have a powerful
_**wavetable player**_ that you can use with your own samples, and a _**puredata**_ patch player.

1. Three function modes
  * wavetable player .gig, .sf2 e .sfz
  * mod duo pedalboards player
  * puredata patch player
2. In/Out
  * optoisolated midi input (connect directly keyboards, synths)
  * usb host port for usb midi controllers
  * high impedance instrument input (guitar/bass)
  * stereo line out
3. Control
  * high contrast oled display
  * three micro switches
  * connect usb to a Pc to copy samples or custom plugins (usb drive)
4. Performance
  * quad core cortex A53 processor with 1GB of ram
  * audio codec 24bit/48/96/192kHz
  * 64-bit internal processing
