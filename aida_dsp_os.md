### What's included

Aida DSP OS comes fully assembled with acrylic (transparent) case and require no soldering work. Included in the software
package:
- 3,8GB of samples ready to play in soundfonts player mode see [samples list](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11b5uSavJboytXnDFgocN8cjFrTf7xIc7?usp=sharing)
- 430 lv2 plugins see [plugins list](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11b5uSavJboytXnDFgocN8cjFrTf7xIc7?usp=sharing)

### Advantages

- High definition audio codec with ultra low noise clock source
- RT Preempt kernel means low and stable audio latency (10ms or less).
- Operative system realized with Yocto means higher system stability: no unuseful software
is installed on the board (forget antivirus popups or security ads or advertisements of any kind)
- Advanced partitioning: the filesystem is partitioned to increase disk streaming performance and no write is performed during operation (prevents sd card damage)
- Based on open source software:
  * create your soundfont in SFZ format. How-to [here]({{ '/howto_make_your_own_sfz_soundfont.html' | absolute_url }})
  * develop your own plugin using the sdk provided. How-to [here]({{ '/howto_sdk_lv2_plugins.html' | absolute_url }})
  * create your own patch with puredata
- Ease of operation: when started in usb storage mode, the board can be connected with USB cable to a Pc for transferring new samples, plugins or patches.

### Not included

- Power supply: 5V/2A. You can use a standard 2A phone charger with micro USB connector, or a [Raspberry Pi's adapter](https://www.amazon.it/Aukru-Alimentatore-Raspberry-modello-Modello/dp/B01566WOAG/ref=sr_1_8?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=raspberry+pi+supply&qid=1569943965&s=gateway&sr=8-8). Optionally if you
have a low noise USB 5V supply port (i.e. for USB souncard in recording studios) would be even better.
