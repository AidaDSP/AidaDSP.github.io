technology of the _**Mod Duo**_, a device presented at _NAMM 2017_. In addition to that, you have a powerful
_**wavetable player**_ that you can use with your own samples, and a _**puredata**_ patch player.

2. In/Out

  * usb host port for usb midi controllers
  * high impedance instrument input (guitar/bass)
  * stereo line out
3. Control
  * high contrast oled display
  * three micro switches
  * connect usb to a Pc to copy samples or custom plugins (usb drive)
