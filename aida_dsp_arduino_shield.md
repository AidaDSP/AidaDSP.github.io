## Aida DSP Arduino Shield

Aida DSP is an audio shield for Arduino for those who wants to learn or teach _**STEM**_, and for _DIYers_ who want to just make their
own audio effect without sacrifycing the sound quality

### Specs
- Compact design size (Arduino shield form factor)
- Low noise design for audio applications
- 2 mono inputs 4 mono outputs
- Pro audio A/D D/A conversion: 24 bits, 48/96/192kHz
- Dedicated crimpable connectors to host encoder, buttons and pots
- Expansion connector with available signals from DSP
- Available open source examples for Arduino boards
- Compatible with Arduino Uno/Mega/Due/Zero

### How it works

1. DSP firmware
> > The DSP firmare is developed in Sigma Studio, a proprietary tool which implements an intuitive graphical design workflow. From Sigma Studio you can export an .xml file which contains DSP firmware and then with our [Java tool](https://github.com/AidaDSP/AidaDSP/tree/master/Software/Java/AidaHeaderFileGenerator/bin) you can generate a C header file to be used in the Arduino IDE.

2. Arduino sketch
> > Now you're ready to code a sketch that communicates with the DSP in real time to control its algorithm using [Aida DSP Arduino library](https://github.com/AidaDSP/AidaDSP/tree/master/Software/Libraries).

3. Create!
> > Basically you can manage your UI (user interface: buttons, faders, etc.) with Arduino and then let the DSP do the whole hard work of processing audio. For example you can use the DSP to generate a sine tone and change its frequency and amplitude with a pot wired to Arduino's analog input. Check out our [examples](https://github.com/AidaDSP/AidaDSP/tree/master/Software/Examples) on Github!

### Typical applications
- 1st and 2nd order equalizers with adjustable f, Q, gain
- Processors with peak or rms detection for monochannel
  and multichannel dynamics
- Mixers and splitters
- Tone and noise generators
- Fixed and variable gain
- Loudness
- Delay 
- Stereo enhancement
- Dynamic bass boost
- FIR & IIR filters
- Level detectors
- GPIO control and conditioning
- Special function to update DSP parameters in real-time without clicks and pops
