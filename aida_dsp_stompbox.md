## Aida DSP Stompbox

Using the same DSP in Aida DSP Arduino Shield, _Aida DSP Stompbox_ claims to be ones of the few
fully programmable stompboxes around the world.

### Fully customizable

Are you an owner of a recording studio, an audio professional or just an audio enthusiast? With
_Aida DSP Stompbox_ we offer a product that can be customized upon request not only on the audio
algorithm part, but also on a graphic level, including your logo, your custom name for your new pedal
and more!

### Turn your audio expertise into a finalized product

- Are there some equalization schemes that you use often in your studio? Together we can render
them inside a pedal and you will forget about opening the Pc or installing your software to someone'else DAW.
- Do you like the sound of some compressor presets that you use with your favourite plugin on your DAW? Together we can put them
into a pedal, this will ease your job both while recording bands or during production, since the effect will be exactly in the position where it should be from the beginning
- Are you a producer? It's easier to convince a musician to play through a stompbox since they can be used
together with their own instrumentation and they already know how to deal with it. But a the same time helps you in keeping that particular sound idea
that you have in mind without using a lot of plugins on your DAW later.

### Endless options and combinations

- Hammond Box die cast aluminium case, CNC machine drilled
- Flexible user interface: 2 knobs + 3-way switch or 4 knobs version
- Dual color 3mm led
- True bypass switch

### Solid and durable

We did a huge research among our suppliers to carefully select the components and we made a lot of prototypes before arriving at the current one.
One example? We completely redesigned the electronics to use metallic premium quality knobs screwed onto the case to allow for a road-ready, high quality
product
